# Abdul Ahad  
I have an MS in Mechanical Engineering, but I decided to shift into the field of computer science as I found I enjoyed it much more. I'm a beginner programmer / web developer, currently interested in developing websites and applications to improve my own knowledge and experience. I have taken CS50, Harvard's introductory course to computer science, and am currently self-learning more about web development basics.  
My current interests are:  
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Wordpress
* Python
